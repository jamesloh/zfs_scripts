Title:       zfs_scripts

Description: A collection of scripts to use ZFS

Environments: These scripts work on Solaris 10, OpenSolaris, OpenIndiana and native ZFS on Linux.

Configuration:
  Just copy these scripts to /usr/bin

Usage:
  zfSnap is used to snapshot a filesystem
  By systematically appending a timestamp to the snapshot name, snapshots become more manageable.
  Comments can be appended to a snapshot right after the filesystem, e.g., 
   zfSnap tank/pos daily_backup

Here is a typical crontab.

0,15,30,45 9-21 * * 1-6 zfSnap tank/pos
0 22 * * 6 su - root -c "zpool scrub extrapool"
0 4 * * 6 su - root -c "rm_uncommented_snaps"
0 8 * * 6 su - root -c "zpool status" | mailx -s "`date` zpool status for storage" admin@example.com

Every 15 mins, the pos filesystem is snapshot. Through the magic of ZFS, a .zfs/snapshot sub-directory will be in pos directory.
Each snapshot will be stored in a timestamped subdirectory. This makes it extremely easy to copy just the needed file from any snapshot.
